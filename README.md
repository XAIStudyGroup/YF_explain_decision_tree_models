# Explain Decision Tree Models

## Description
This repository holds the material for teaching how to explain decision tree models.

## File description  
Because the example given by Molnar's book is not strictly a classfication, to avoid confuse students, I used iris dataset instead to demo the explanation. I still prepared an R script and a Jupyter Notebook for the bike dataset, and that is why we have two sets of scripts.

**XAI_decision_tree_bike.ipynb** and **decision_tree_bike.R**: Demo code for the bike example
**XAI_decision_tree_iris.ipynb** and **decision_tree_iris.R**: Demo code for the iris example
